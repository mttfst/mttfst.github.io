Today I am starting my blog project Mattfisto.eu.
My name is Matthias and I am working as an atmospheric scientist in the modeling department of the [Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research](https://www.tropos.de/en/){:target="_blank"} in Leipzig.

During my work I run into problems all the time.
At Coding, plotting, data processing, etc...
And I really love it to find solutions to all my problems.
Since I started my Ph.D. I solved a lot of these puzzles, but anyway no matter how much I learned I run into the same problems over and over again.

So this is basically the aim of this Blog.
I want to write down all the clever solution  I come across in my daily business in order to help me when I run into a problem I already had. And maybe I can also help you to solve one of your issues.
